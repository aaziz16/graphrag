-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

-Examples-

Example 1:

text:
 1: Fire-resistance-rated wall areas above finished ceilings, whether or not accessible
in the completed construction.
a. Joints and interior angles shall have tape set in joint compound.
b. Surfaces shall be free of excess joint compound.
c. Tool marks and ridges are acceptable.
d. Tape and fastener heads do not need to be covered with joint compound.
D. Tape, fill, and sand exposed joints, edges, and corners to produce smooth surface ready to
receive finishes.
1. Feather coats of joint compound so that camber is maximum 1/32 inch.
3.10
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL
A. See Section 01 40 00 - Quality Requirements, for additional requirements.
B. Remove, repair and reinstall or restore in place damaged items prior to inspection for Substantial
Completion.
1. Remove all twisted and damaged or otherwise defective framing, replace with new framing.
2. Replace board work that cannot be repaired to conceal defects.
