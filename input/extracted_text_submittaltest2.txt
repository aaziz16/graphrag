ECOSMART PANELS
FIRECODE 30
Sustainable and ultralightweight 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) panels for interior wall and ceiling applications
. Meet Architecture 2030 Challenge for Products
- Up to 25% less global warming potential (GWP)1
- Up to 30% less weight reduces transportation fuel energy by up to 20%
. Living Building Challenge™ Red List Free
· Contain 100% USDA certified biobased content
· Up to 97.3% recycled content (regionally available)
· Achieved GREENGUARD Gold Certification and qualifies as a low VOC emitting material
(meets CA 01350)
. USGBC® LEED® v4-may assist in achieving additional credits
. Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) Classification as to fire resistance (30-minute and 1-hour
fire-rated walls), surface-burning characteristics and noncombustibility
· Comply with ASTM C1396, Standard Specification for Gypsum Board, for 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) and
non-Type X gypsum wallboard
· Offer comparable strength and sag resistance to standard 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Type X
Note:
1. Compared to standard 5/8 in. (15,9 mm) Type X gypsum panels as presented in the Gypsum Association's 5/8 in. (15.9 mm)
Type X Conventional Gypsum Board Environmental Product Declaration (EPD 10270).
USG Sheetrock® Brand EcoSmart Panels Firecode 30® (UL Type FC30) are lightweight 5/8 in.
(15.9 mm) gypsum panels that have been formulated to achieve all of the same strength and
physical performance characteristics as standard 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) USG Sheetrock® Brand
Firecode® X Panels at a lower environmental impact and reduced weight. The panels feature an
innovative noncombustible gypsum core that is encased in 100% recycled face and back papers
that form a high strength-to-weight ratio composite design. The face paper is folded around the
long edges to reinforce and protect the core, and the ends are cut square and even. The long
edges of panels are tapered, allowing joints to be reinforced and concealed with USG Sheetrock®
Brand joint treatment systems. The panels are UL Classified for fire resistance and can be used
in any UL Design in which Type FC30 panels are listed. On the face along the long edge of each
panel, the UL Type Designation is printed for easy identification by building inspectors.
· Commercial or residential applications where 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Type X panels are not required
for steel- or wood-framed wall and ceiling assemblies
. New or repair and remodel construction
· Single-layer wood- or steel-framed 30-minute fire-rated wall assemblies
. Double-layer steel-framed 1-hour fire-rated wall assemblies
1. Avoid exposure to sustained temperatures exceeding 125ºF (52℃).
2. Avoid exposure to excessive, repetitive or continuous moisture before, during and after
installation. Eliminate sources of moisture immediately.
3. Not an ASTM C1396-defined Type X panel.
4. Must be stored off the ground and under cover in accordance with Gypsum Association's
GA-801, Handling and Storage of Gypsum Panel Products.

INSTALLATION
For maximum framing spacing in non-fire-resistance-rated applications of gypsum panel products,
refer to Gypsum Association's GA-216, Specifications for the Application and Finishing of Gypsum
Panel Products or ASTM C840, Standard Specification for Application and Finishing of Gypsum Board.
For fire-resistance-rated applications, refer to the published UL Design or GA File Number.

spaced at 16 in. (406 mm) OC or perpendicular to framing spaced maximum 24 in. (610 mm) OC. See Appendix A.3 of Gypsum
Association's GA-216, Specifications for the Application and Finishing of Gypsum Panel Products for more information.
FINISHING AND DECORATING
For high-quality finishing results, USG recommends USG Sheetrock® Brand finishing products.
Painting products and systems should be used that comply with recommendations and
requirements in Appendices of ASTM C840. For priming and decorating with paint, texture or
wall covering, follow manufacturer's directions for materials used. Gypsum Association's GA-214,
Recommended Levels of Finish for Gypsum Board, Glass Mat and Fiber-Reinforced Gypsum Panels
should be referred to in order to determine the level of finishing needed to ensure a surface
properly prepared to accept the final decoration.
All surfaces, including applied joint compound, must be thoroughly dry, dust-free and not glossy.
Prime with USG Sheetrock® Brand First Coat™ Primer or with an undiluted, interior latex flat paint
with high-solids content. Allow to dry before decorating.
To improve fastener concealment where gypsum panel walls and ceilings will be subjected to
critical artificial or natural lighting, or will be decorated with a gloss paint (eggshell, semigloss
or gloss), the gypsum panel should be skim coated with joint compound. This equalizes suction
and texture differences between the drywall face paper and the finished joint compound before
painting. When a Level 5 finish is required, use USG Sheetrock® Brand Tuff-Hide™ Primer-Surfacer.
See USG Sheetrock® Brand Tuff-Hide™ Primer-Surfacer Submittal Sheet (J1613) for limitations and
application instructions.
For more information, refer to USG literature Finishing & Decorating Gypsum Panels White Paper
(J2010).
