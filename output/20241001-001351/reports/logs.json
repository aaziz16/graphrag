They provide essential support for other construction materials, including the exterior soffit board. These members are integral to the construction process, as they serve as the primary support structure to which gypsum boards are applied, initially to ceilings at right angles and subsequently to walls. Their role is crucial in ensuring the stability and integrity of the overall construction framework.\",4\r\n700,END JOINTS,\"END JOINTS: The joints at the ends of gypsum boards should be staggered and not occur on opposite sides of a partition. They should be staggered over framing members or other solid backing to ensure stability. Additionally, in exterior sheathing, these joints need to be butted tight and occur over firm bearing to maintain structural integrity.\",6\r\n699,ROUGH OPENINGS,\"ROUGH OPENINGS are openings left in the construction to allow for the installation of other trades. Specifically, these openings are left in the gypsum board for the installation of other trades, with board joints strategically located to avoid alignment with the edges of the openings unless control joints are installed. This ensures structural integrity and accommodates the necessary installations without compromising the construction quality.\",5\r\n696,PENETRATIONS,\"PENETRATIONS refer to openings or holes in construction materials, including gypsum board, walls, floors, or ceilings, through which pipes, ducts, conduits, or other elements pass. These penetrations need to be sealed with a water-resistant sealant, except in cases where firestopping is provided. This ensures that the integrity of the construction is maintained, preventing water ingress and maintaining fire safety standards where applicable.\",3\r\n690,FIRESTOPPING,\"FIRESTOPPING is a process or material used to prevent the spread of fire through openings created by penetrations in the gypsum board. It involves materials specifically designed to seal openings and joints in fire-resistance-rated wall and floor assemblies, thereby preventing the spread of fire and smoke. This critical safety measure ensures that fire and smoke are contained within designated areas, enhancing the overall fire safety of a building.\",2\r\n703,BOARD JOINTS,\"The joints between gypsum boards, which need to be located so that no end joint aligns with the edges of openings unless control joints are installed\",3\r\n716,EXTERIOR SOFFIT BOARD,\"The EXTERIOR SOFFIT BOARD is a type of board installed perpendicular to framing with staggered end joints over framing members or other solid backing.

The guidelines ensure that all materials are installed correctly to meet the manufacturer's standards and specifications.\",6\r\n541,CONTROL JOINTS,CONTROL JOINTS are joints designed to control the location and amount of cracking in gypsum board assemblies by providing a continuous bead of sealant between edges of board panels. These joints are installed at specific points to manage the location of cracks in gypsum board installations and are placed consistent with lines of building spaces to control movement. They are inserted into open joints and stapled to the board. CONTROL JOINTS are also used in construction to manage the location of cracks due to shrinkage and other movements. These one-piece joint assemblies are made of non-corrosive metal or extruded vinyl and comply with ASTM C1047 standards.,18\r\n685,SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES,\"\"\"SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES\"\" are accessories that are applied to the surface of construction elements.

These instructions cover various aspects, including the installation of control joint strips, gypsum board assemblies, and the proper installation and spacing of materials. The guidelines ensure that all materials are installed correctly to meet the manufacturer's standards and specifications.\",6\r\n541,CONTROL JOINTS,CONTROL JOINTS are joints designed to control the location and amount of cracking in gypsum board assemblies by providing a continuous bead of sealant between edges of board panels. These joints are installed at specific points to manage the location of cracks in gypsum board installations and are placed consistent with lines of building spaces to control movement. They are inserted into open joints and stapled to the board. CONTROL JOINTS are also used in construction to manage the location of cracks due to shrinkage and other movements. These one-piece joint assemblies are made of non-corrosive metal or extruded vinyl and comply with ASTM C1047 standards.,18\r\n685,SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES,\"\"\"SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES\"\" are accessories that are applied to the surface of construction elements. Specifically, when applied to gypsum board assemblies, these accessories necessitate a continuous bead of sealant at control joints prior to installation. This ensures proper adhesion and functionality, highlighting the importance of sealant in maintaining the integrity of the installation.\",2\r\n725,INSTALLATION OF TRIM AND ACCESSORIES,\"The \"\"INSTALLATION OF TRIM AND ACCESSORIES\"\" involves the process of installing various components such as control joints, corner beads, and edge trim. This process is integral to construction, ensuring that all trim and accessory elements are properly fitted and secured. The installation of these components is crucial for both the aesthetic and functional aspects of a building, providing necessary support and finishing touches to the structure.\",3\r\n724,CONTROL JOINT STRIPS,\"CONTROL JOINT STRIPS are strips that are inserted into open joints to form control joints. These strips have flanges that are stapled to the board, ensuring they are securely attached. The primary function of these strips is to manage and control the natural movement of materials, preventing cracks and structural issues in construction projects.\",2\r\n715,EXTERIOR SOFFITS,\"EXTERIOR SOFFITS refer to the underside of an exterior architectural feature, such as an overhang or eave.

The guidelines ensure that all materials are installed correctly to meet the manufacturer's standards and specifications.\",6\r\n541,CONTROL JOINTS,CONTROL JOINTS are joints designed to control the location and amount of cracking in gypsum board assemblies by providing a continuous bead of sealant between edges of board panels. These joints are installed at specific points to manage the location of cracks in gypsum board installations and are placed consistent with lines of building spaces to control movement. They are inserted into open joints and stapled to the board. CONTROL JOINTS are also used in construction to manage the location of cracks due to shrinkage and other movements. These one-piece joint assemblies are made of non-corrosive metal or extruded vinyl and comply with ASTM C1047 standards.,18\r\n685,SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES,\"\"\"SURFACE APPLIED ACCESSORIES\"\" are accessories that are applied to the surface of construction elements.

This suggests that gypsum panels may contribute to reduced resource consumption and lower emissions, thereby minimizing waste and promoting environmental sustainability.\",2\r\n44,UL CLASSIFIED,Certification indicating that the panels are classified for fire resistance by Underwriters Laboratories (UL),2\r\n57,LONG EDGES,The edges of the gypsum panels that are folded and tapered to reinforce and protect the core and allow for joint treatment,2\r\n33,USG SHEETROCK® BRAND FIRECODE® X PANELS,\"USG SHEETROCK® BRAND FIRECODE® X PANELS are standard 5/8 in.

These panels are distinguished by their superior physical performance characteristics, making them a reliable choice for construction projects requiring enhanced safety and durability.\",2\r\n38,REDUCED WEIGHT,\"\"\"REDUCED WEIGHT\"\" refers to a characteristic of a material that has been made lighter in weight compared to standard versions. Specifically, this characteristic applies to gypsum panels, which are lighter in weight compared to standard panels. This reduction in weight can offer various benefits, such as easier handling, reduced transportation costs, and potentially lower structural load requirements in construction projects.\",2\r\n63,1-HOUR FIRE-RATED WALL ASSEMBLIES,\"Wall assemblies rated for 1 hour of fire resistance, which can be double-layer and steel-framed\",1\r\n62,30-MINUTE FIRE-RATED WALL ASSEMBLIES,\"Wall assemblies rated for 30 minutes of fire resistance, which can be single-layer and wood- or steel-framed\",1\r\n56,BACK PAPER,\"The paper that covers the back of the gypsum panels, contributing to the high strength-to-weight ratio composite design\",1\r\n59,BUILDING INSPECTORS,\"BUILDING INSPECTORS are individuals responsible for ensuring that construction complies with building codes and regulations.
