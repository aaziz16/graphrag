USG Sheetrock® Brand Glass-Mat Panels Mold Tough® VHI Firecode® X (UL Type AR) are 5/8 in.
(15.9 mm) Type X panels designed and tested to offer greater resistance to surface abrasion,
indentation and impact damage than 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) USG Sheetrock® Brand Glass-Mat Panels
Mold Tough® Firecode® X. These abuse-resistant panels feature a noncombustible, moisture-resistant
gypsum core that is encased in a green colored fiberglass face and back that shed water. When
tested in accordance with ASTM D3273, Standard Test Method for Resistance to Growth of Mold on
the Surface of Interior Coatings in an Environmental Chamber, the panels score a "10" (highest). The
fiberglass face is folded around the long edges to reinforce and protect the core, and the ends are
cut square and even. The long edges of the panels are tapered, allowing joints to be reinforced and
concealed with USG Sheetrock® Brand joint treatment systems. The panels are UL Classified for fire
resistance and can be used in any UL Design in which Type AR panels are listed.
· Commercial or residential applications where 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) moisture- and mold-resistant Type X
panels with greater resistance to surface abrasion, indentation and impact damage are required
· Areas where additional abuse resistance is desired
· Areas where glass-mat panels are desired
. Load-bearing and nonload-bearing wood- or steel-framed fire-rated walls
. New or repair and remodel construction
1. Avoid sustained exposure to temperatures exceeding 125ºF (52°℃).
2. Avoid exposure to excessive, repetitive or continuous moisture before, during and after
installation. Eliminate sources of moisture immediately.
3. Must be stored off the ground and under cover in accordance with Gypsum Association's

4. For abuse-resistant construction over steel stud framing, minimum 20-gauge (0.0296 in.
[0.752 mm] base metal thickness) steel studs, as defined by the Steel Stud Manufacturers
Association (SSMA), are recommended.
5. Not intended for exterior applications or constant exposure to water. Protect from immersion in
water and the eroding effects of cascading water.
6. Building must be dried-in prior to installation in soffits and other horizontal applications. Wall
cavities, floor cavities and other enclosed areas, including insulation, must be dry prior to being
closed-up and application of interior finishing.
7. Not suitable for use as a substrate for tile in wet areas such as tubs and showers, gang showers,
and other areas subject to direct water exposure.
8. Use as a wall tile substrate is limited to tile installed according to current TCNA and ANSI
specifications. Consult with adhesive and tile manufacturers for recommendations for maximum
size and weight parameters for use with gypsum panels.

Association's GA-216, Specifications for the Application and Finishing of Gypsum Panel Products for more information ..
USG Sheetrock® Brand Glass-Mat Panels Mold Tough® VHI Firecode® X are by design stronger and
have greater surface hardness than standard 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) Type X panels. Because of this,
they are heavier and will be more difficult to install. Slower installation production rates should be
accounted for in job planning.
Installing USG Sheetrock® Brand Glass-Mat Panels Mold Tough® VHI Firecode® X on steel thinner than
20-gauge (minimum 0.0296 in. [0.752 mm] base metal thickness), as defined by the SSMA, may
result in increased fastener strip-out, improper screwhead seating or other related conditions. For
more information, refer to USG TechNOTE Reducing Occurrences of Screw Spinout on Steel Studs
When Installing Abuse- & Impact-Resistant Gypsum Panels (ST700).
FINISHING AND DECORATING
For high-quality finishing results, USG recommends USG Sheetrock® Brand finishing products.
The nature of the texture and absorption properties of the panel will require an additional skim
coat of the entire panel surface with joint compound in most applications. Additionally, an aesthetic
benchmark or mock-up is recommended for establishing and demonstrating an approved finishing
system to coordinate the expectations of the design professionals with those of the contracted
workforce. The finished appearance of the constructed standard should be approved in advance of
any widespread work.
Painting products and systems should be used that comply with recommendations and requirements
in Appendices of ASTM C840. For priming and decorating with paint, texture or wall covering, follow
manufacturer's directions for materials used. Gypsum Association's GA-214, Recommended Levels
of Finish for Gypsum Board, Glass Mat and Fiber-Reinforced Gypsum Panels should be referred to in
order to determine the level of finishing needed to ensure a surface properly prepared to accept the
final decoration.

INTERIOR INSTALLATION,
FINISHING AND DECORATING, CONT.
FINISHING AND DECORATING
All surfaces, including applied joint compound, must be thoroughly dry, dust-free and not glossy.
Prime with USG Sheetrock® Brand First Coat™ Primer or with an undiluted, interior latex flat paint
with high-solids content. Allow to dry before decorating.
To improve fastener concealment where gypsum panel walls and ceilings will be subjected to critical
artificial or natural lighting, or will be decorated with a gloss paint (eggshell, semigloss or gloss), the
gypsum panel should be skim coated with joint compound. This equalizes suction and texture
differences between the fiberglass face and the finished joint compound before painting. When a
Level 5 finish is required, use USG Sheetrock® Brand Tuff-Hide™ Primer-Surfacer. See USG Sheetrock®
Brand Tuff-Hide™ Primer-Surfacer Submittal Sheet (J1613) for limitations and application instructions.
For more information, refer to USG literature Finishing and Decorating Glass-Mat Gypsum Panels

2. Per ASTM C1658 for 5/8 in. (15.9 mm) glass mat gypsum panels.
MOISTURE AND MOLD RESISTANCE
Per ASTM C473, Test Methods for Physical Testing of Gypsum Panel Products, the average water
absorption for USG Sheetrock® Brand Glass-Mat Panels Mold Tough® VHI Firecode® X is not greater
than 5% by weight after two-hour immersion.
In independent lab tests conducted per ASTM D3273 at the time of manufacture, the panels score
a "10", meeting ASTM C1658 specifications. This ASTM lab test may not accurately represent the
mold performance of building materials in actual use. Given unsuitable project conditions during
storage, installation or after completion, any building material can be overwhelmed by mold.
To manage the growth of mold, the best and most cost-effective strategy is to protect building
products from water exposure during storage and installation and after completion of the building.
This can be accomplished by using good design and construction practices.

Test Summary
Test Results
Abrasion Resistance
ASTM D4977
A sample is placed under a wire brush weighted
with 25 lbs. (11,3 kg). The brush is then cycled
50 times back and forth across the surface.
This creates surface wear that is measured to
determine the level of abrasion resistance.
ASTM C1629
Classification Levels
Maximum Depth
Level 1 = 0.126 in. (3.2 mm)
Level 2 = 0.059 in. (1,5 mm)
Level 3 = 0.010 in. (0.3 mm)
Level 23
Indentation
Resistance
ASTM D5420
A 2 lb. (0.91 kg) weight is raised to a 36 in, (914 mm)
height and dropped onto a 5/8 in. (15.9 mm)
hemispherical die that strikes the sample with
72 in.lb (12.6 J) of force. The depth of the
indentation is measured to determine the level of
indentation resistance.
Maximum Depth
Level 1 = 0.150 in. (3.8 mm)
Level 2 = 0.100 in. (2,5 mm)
Level 3 = 0.050 in. (1,3 mm)
Level 1
Soft-Body Impact
Resistance
ASTM C1629
A 60 lb. (27.2 kg) leather bag is suspended on a rope
and raised away angularly from a sample installed
on 2 x 4 in. (38 x 89 mm) wood framing 16 in.
(406 mm) OC. The bag is raised (in 6 in, [152 mm]
increments) and released to impact the sample.
The impact energy is calculated based upon the
bag weight and drop height where structural failure
occurs.
Minimum ft.lbf
Level 3
(structural failure)
Level 1 = 90 ft .lbf (122 J)
Level 2 = 195 ft.lbf (265 J)
Level 3 = 300 ft.Ibf (408 J)
Hard-Body Impact
Resistance
ASTM C1629
A 2 x 2 ft. (610 x 610 mm) sample is mounted
vertically to a metal frame and impacted with a
2.75 in. (70 mm) diameter weighted swinging ram
(resembling a sledgehammer). Weight is added
in 2.5 lb. (1.1 kg) increments to increase the impact
force. Failure energy is determined when penetration
through the face into the frame cavity occurs.
Minimum ft.lbf
(structural failure)
Level 1 = 50 ft.Ibf (68 J)
Level 2 = 100 ft.Ibf (136 J)
Level 3 = 150 ft.lbf (204 J)
Level 2
Note:
3. USG testing demonstrates that when painted with one coat of primer and two coats of semigloss latex paint, the abrasion
resistance increases to Level 3.
